					<strong><em>User Interviews</em> are important because the designer will be able to gain an insight on what others think/expect about their product.
					Not only that, the designer will be able to get an idea of their user before they ask them the hard-hitting questions about the product.
					Typically, the designer would want a variety of users to obtain information based on their differing viewpoints.
					The types of questions asked should definitely be important and relevant to the assignment.
					Asking about their role, problems, goals, process, success, obstacles, features, and concerns about their life and the project at hand is helpful
					to not only your product, but knowing who your user is.

							<p></p>
                                <strong> A <em>competitor analysis</em> is essentially an analysis (that could be in a graph or table) of competitors for your product.
								It could be an actual product or a portfolio (like in this case). 
								The types of competitors that can be reviewed are typically those who are aiming for the same goal as you are.
								For this analysis, I used 3 people in the UX industry. I reviewed them because those people are essentially aiming for the same goal as I am.
								In a competitive industry standpoint, we are both aiming for the same job; therefore, it's best to analyze them. It's informative to gain an insight
								on who your competitors are, and how they may or may not be standing out more than you.

							<p></p>
								<strong>A <em>feature value matrix</em> is a essentially about different, potential features and how they are valued in different standpoints (user, business, and dev).
								It contains features that you may want to add to your project, and it's scored on their user value, business value, and development value.
								I selected the features I did because I noticed these features were missing from my portfolio.
								Regardless if the feature was something I wanted to implement or not, I added them within my feature value matrix because it was missing from my portfolio. 
								That way, I can try and gauge what their user, business, and development value would be. If it was high enough, I can consider
								adding it to my project.

								<strong>I <em>prioritized the features</em> based on the different values (user, business, and dev) from the feature value matrix. 
								To complete the feature prioritization graph, I had to set out each feature determined by its priority level.
								This can be incorporated into building an interface by deciding each feature's importance. If it is important and easy to implement, it
								would most likely be implemented first. If it is important and hard to implement, it would still definitely be implemented; however,
								it might take longer to complete.
								Based on the feature's importance, the developer can work on what's easy to implement and important first.

							<strong>A <em>cognitive walkthrough</em> is when the designer makes the user go through a series of tasks.
							It is important because it allows the designer to see if their design works as well as they thought it did. 
							If the user performs exactly like how the designer intended, their design works well.
							Some challenges that can be faced when conducting them is the user not understanding the design at all.
							If the user can't find what the designer is asking them to find, it can be difficult for the designer to see.

								Due to the time constraint and people being busy, even performing a one-minute test can be difficult to accomplish.

					<summary><strong>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</strong> </summary>
					<section>
					<p></p>
						<strong>
						When performing the <em>user interviews</em>, I found that it was interesting to hear about people's expectations about a portfolio. 
						It was also interesting to hear their life story. People value different things, and I believe that shows in what they find useful or interesting. 
						I found the <em>competitor analysis</em> was the most insightful. It made me compare my portfolio to others in the industry. 
						There were features that I didn't think about or forgot to add (like a list of works/projects). It was really interesting to see how
						everyone laid out their website as well. The <em>feature value matrix and feature prioritization</em> were both interesting
						also. They definitely go hand-in-hand. Once the feature value matrix is completed, performing a feature prioritization graph is the next logical step.
						The feature value matrix, in particular, was insightful because it made me determine a feature's user value, business value, and development value.
						The evaluation process was different, and I had to gauge what each value would be in their standpoints.
						The <em>user stories</em> were similar to the feature value matrix for me; however, I had to act as a certain type of user. I had to determine what they want 
						and how they know they've succeeded. It may or may not be completely accurate to the actual user, but it's a start.
						The <em>cognitive walkthrough</em> was the easiest for me to complete. Since my portfolio is rather simple,
						I found that my users had an easy time performing the tasks. Even though it was straight-forward, I found that it's a good thing. My contents are laid out for 
						the users in a simple, easy to read manner. Lastly, the <em>user tests</em> were the hardest to read for me. Performing the "Click Test" was fine because it was simple
						and the testers understood how to perform the task. The "Question Test", on the other hand, was different. I'm glad I chose it, but it was interesting to say the least. Even though
						it was just 20%, 20% of my testers couldn't read all the font clearly and without problems. Granted, they could have been taking the test on a mobile device and couldn't see
						it as well as they could; however, it was really upsetting. Overall, all of my testers had different opinions and different things that they suggest I add to the portfolio. It was all very 
						helpful, but it's a lot to take in. <br />
						In general, I didn't face any particular challenges when performing user research or user testing. I suppose the only challenge was reading
						what people had to say about my portfolio for the user tests, but I was able to absorb their advice afterward.
						Overall, I found that people have different opinions on my portfolio. While some would say they could read the text,
						others have said that they couldn't. Not only that, people had mixed feelings on if they want to see a portfolio be 
						simple or at least have a bit of interaction. I thought my findings were really informative, and it has definitely helped me 
						gain insight on how my audience feels about my portfolio. This entire process has helped me understand how my interface can 
						be improved. Even if it's an unpopular vote (like changing my picture), I think changing it would be worth the result. 
						I want my portfolio to be usable and helpful for everyone.

					<summary><strong>INCORPORATION OF FINDINGS</strong> </summary>
					<section>
					<p></p>
						<strong>The only finding that I have incorporated so far is changing the size of the font. Based on a suggestion from the first final assignment,
						I have, not only changed the size of the font, I have also changed the font itself. I plan on incorporating the other findings during winter break. 
						It will mainly be based on how the feature prioritization list is laid out. First, the list of works/projects will definitely have to be incorporated.
					    I would want users to see the different projects I've worked on, and I would want it to be implemented in a grid-style layout. The grid-style layout 
						would be incorporated afterward; however, I still believe it goes hand-in-hand. Next, an anchor would be important for the list of works/projects.
						Since I plan on being in UX, I will have to do a lot explaining about my projects. It would be nice if users had an anchor at the bottom that allows them to quickly
						return to the top. Next, the search bar and contact form would be implemented. Depending on how much information I have at the end, I may or may not 
						believe a search bar is necessary. The contact form would also be interesting to implement; however, I have done research on github and they don't 
						support PHP for a contact form. There are, however, workarounds to that. Lastly, I most likely won't implement the instagram feed, blog feature,
						or hamburger menu. Adding an instagram feed or blog feature would be fun, but I feel like it's such a low priority that it might not be worth it.
						Lastly, the hamburger menu is a hit or miss because it's misused all the time and can be confusing.<br />
						So far, since I just had to change the size of the font from the first comment on my portfolio, I haven't been through any challenges; however,
						I might have trouble implementing the grid-style layout and making sure that it's responsive. I will have to do a lot of research on that, but that's
						what winter break is for! I suppose another challenge was finding the right font. I didn't want a font that was too generic, but I still wanted it to be readable.
						After testing different fonts for a few hours, I believe I finally found the right one. I have to bold it to make it stand out more, but I think it's still generally easy to read.
						This process has helped in my understanding of how my interface can be improved. If I didn't perform the competitor analysis, cognitive walkthrough,
						or user test, I wouldn't have known the different features I could add to my portfolio to improve it. Everything is always a work in progress, but 
						performing those tests definitely helped me realize my end goal faster.
