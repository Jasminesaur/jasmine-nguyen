                                <strong> A <em>Competitor analysis</em> is essentially an analysis (that could be in a graph or table) of competitors for your product.<br />
								The types of competitors that can be reviewd are usually those who are aiming for the same goal as you are.<br />
								For example, I used people in the UX industry. I reviewed them because those people are technically going for the same thing I am.<br />
								In  acompetitive standpoint, we are both aiming for the same job.<br />

								<strong>A <em>feature value matrix</em> is a table stating different features and how they are valued in different standpoints (user, business, and dev)<br />
								I selected the features I did because I noticed these features were missing from my portfolio.<br />
								Regardless if they were something I wanted to implement or not, I added them within my feature value matrix.<br />
								That way, I can try and understand the value from different perspectives.<br />

								<strong>I <em>prioritized the features</em> based on the different standpoints from the feature value matrix. <br />
								If I believed that it was useful, I ended up taking the different values of that and putting it onto the graph. <br />
								This can be incorporated into building an interface by deciding what is more important.<br />
								Based on the importance, the developer can work on what's easy to implement and important first.<br />

							<strong>A <em>cognitive walkthrough</em> is when the designer makes the user go through a series of tasks.<br />
							It is important because it allows the designer to see if their design works as well as they thought it did. <br />
							If the user performs exactly like how the designer intended, their design works well.<br />
							Some challenges that can be faced when conducting them is the user not understanding the design at all.<br />
							If the user can't find what the designer is asking them to find, it can be difficult for the designer to see. <br />

								<strong>The types of <em>user tests</em> that I conducted are the "Click Test" and the "Question Test".<br />
								I chose these tests because they were the most interesting and fun to do. <br />
								The Question Test is also very informative. <br />
								Some challenges that I faced was getting people to perform the test. <br />
								Due to the time constraint and people being busy, even performing a one-minute test can be difficult to accomplish.<br />
								Overall, the test results were varied.<br />
								What I thought worked well, some people actually didn't. It was hard to hear, but it opened my eyes. <br />

					<p></p>
						<strong>Overall, I found that people have different opinions on my portfolio. While some would say they could read the text,
						others have said that they couldn't. Not only that, people had mixed feelings on if they would want to see a portfolio be 
						simple or at least have a bit of interaction.

					<summary><strong>INCORPORATION OF FINDINGS</strong> </summary>
					<section>
					<p></p>
						<strong>The only finding that I have incorporated so far is changing the size of the font. Based on a suggestion from the first final assignment,
						I have, not only changed the size of the font, I have also changed the font itself. I plan on incorporating the other findings during winter break.
						The first thing I plan on adding is definitely a "Portfolio" section. I would want users to see the different projects I've worked on, and I would
						want it to be implemented in a grid-style layout. So far, since I just had to change the size of the font, I haven't been through any challenges; however,
						I might have trouble implementing the grid-style layout and making sure that it can work on any device.
