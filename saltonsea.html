					<em>The Salton Sea game is a project created in INF 153: Computer-Supported Cooperative Work by a group of 5 students.</em><br />

                     <summary><strong>THE DESIGN ISSUE</strong></summary>
					 <strong>The Design Issue</strong>:<em> To create a game that helps different stakeholder groups understand and discuss proposed plans for managing the Salton Sea.<br />
					 The plan was to teach them how to negotiate (in a manner that will promote effective discussion) a plan that could potentially resolve most, if not all, the Salton Sea's problems. <br />
					 The game is supposed to entice them to keep playing and become more involved within the Salton Sea.</em><br />
					 <p></p>
					 <strong>My Role</strong>: Research the Salton Sea, put the data together, collaborate on requirements, storyboards, mockups, and evaluations.<p></p> 
					 <p></p>
					 The first step was to interview students and research what the Salton Sea was about (by reading articles).<br />
					 We interviewed an environmental science student and a political science student about their knowledge on the Salton Sea.<br />
					 For the most part, they knew about the Salton Sea; however, they didn't know about the entire issue.<br />
					 We gave them an article to read, and they were much more interested about the situation.<br />
					 When asked if they believed a game could help different stakeholder groups, they thought it was an interesting approach.<br />
					 The environmental science student wanted to preserve the Salton Sea, but the political science student didn't think the benefits were great enough.<br />
					 They both insisted that the game would have to be entertaining for the general populace to use it.<br />
					 We also noticed that the game has the potential networking capability.<br />
					 One of the interviewees mentioned that the game should have forums, scientific simulations, and a posting of research to be informative.<br />
					 Lastly, we would have to monitor information being shared to determine what is factual.<br />
					 </details>

					<details>
                     <summary><strong>THE DATA</strong></summary>
					<img src="img\projects\saltonsea\topics.png" alt="Topics" class ="imgsize"><br /><p></p>
					The common topics that showed up during research were: <br />
					1. <strong>Awareness of the Salton Sea</strong>: The interviewees had their own knowledge regarding the Salton Sea<br />
					2. <strong>Potential Game Ideas for Implementation</strong>: Player progression can entice people to keep playing<br />
					3. <strong>Serious Games and Urban Planning</strong>: Urban planning has an impact on Serious Games and can bring attention to the community's environment<br />
					4. <strong>Wilderness</strong>: We came across different engineering and alternative solutions<br />
					<p></p>
					After the interviews, we realized that our stakeholder groups were: <br />
					<div id="fragment-5">
						<li><span class ="spanpadding">Politicians</span></li>
					<li><span class ="spanpadding">Economists</span></li>
					<li><span class ="spanpadding">Local Citizens </span></li>
					<li><span class ="spanpadding">Tourists</span></li>
					</div>
					<p></p>
					<img src="img\projects\saltonsea\thinksay.png" alt="Empathy Diagram" class ="imgsize"><br /><p></p>
					Next, an empathy diagram was created.<br />
					It was chosen because it would allow us to understand who the potential users are and what their needs are.<br />
					It also shows what they hope to do in the game and how they feel about the Salton Sea issue.<br />
					<p></p>
					Lastly, we created a few personas:<br />
					1.<strong> Gene Hu</strong>: <em>Marketing Specialist</em><br />
					He cares by being aware of the importance of keeping the balance between industrial and natural environments.<br />
					He believes the issue is not only about the lake. It is about everyone affected by the sea as well.<br />
					He thinks it's possible to fix the issue by raising awareness within the public.<br /><p></p>
					2. <strong>Anne Green</strong>: <em>Environmental Policy and Planning</em><br />
					She is passionate about keeping a healthy balance between economic and community development and environmental preservation.<br />
					She sees the Salton Sea as a major health issue for the community that surrounds it.<br />
					She believes attempting to restore the sea will be very costly and, possibly, a failure.<br /><p></p>
					3. <strong> Lewis Raynie</strong>: <em>Cashier at Local Market</em><br />
					He isn't the biggest environmental advocate, but he doesn't want the environment to be destroyed either.<br />
					He has lived in Salton City his entire life and has seen the sea go from bad to worse.<br />
					He prefers that the sea be restored to a state that he has only heard about from his father.<br />
					However, if the decision were to get rid of the sea, he would have no qualms about it.<br /><p></p>
					4. <strong> Clark Wilson</strong>: <em>Ecologist</em><br />
					He is a very passionate person when it comes to preserving the environment.<br />
					He wants to fund efforts to maintain the current ecosystem and increase the water input to the lake to create lower salinity levels.<br />
					He believes that cleaning the water already flowing into the Salton Sea would progressively lower the salinity levels.<br />

                     <summary><strong>USER REQUIREMENTS/STORYBOARDS</strong></summary>
					 <img src="img\projects\saltonsea\userneeds.png" alt="User Needs" class ="imgsize"><br /><p></p>
					 After brainstorming 20 user needs, it was narrowed down into 4 key requirements.<br />
					 1. <strong>The game should be educational</strong>: The main purpose of the game is to educate users about the Salton Sea's issues.<br />
					 2. <strong>The game should be affordable/free</strong>: The game design aims to reach as much people as possible since it's an environmental message.<br />
					 3. <strong>The game should be entertaining</strong>: The game must be able to draw in users and teach them about the Salton Sea. <br />
					 4. <strong>The game should allow users to create a profile with basic information</strong>: It encourages the stakeholders with participation and interaction.<br />
					 <p></p>
					 <img src="img\projects\saltonsea\solutions.png" alt="Solutions" class ="imgsize"><br /><p></p>
					 After brainstorming 35 design solutions, it was narrowed down into 3 and made into storyboards.<br />
					 1. <strong>An RPG that will make the player a chosen stakeholder to manage the sea along with a story of the Salton Sea issues.</strong><br />
					 2. <strong>A simulation game where the players are part of different stakeholder groups, and each is assigned to an area of the sea.</strong><br />
					 3. <strong>An educational game that explains different stakeholder perspectives to the player and allows them to discern between the pros and cons of each perspective.</strong><br />
					 <p></p>
					 The three design solutions were chosen based on how well it addresses the research problem.<br />
					 1. <em>The idea of an RPG provides education, entertainment, and profiles for interaction between users.</em><br />
					 2. <em>The simulation would show how each stakeholder group's solutions to the Salton Sea's issues would compare to others and show which is most effective.</em><br />
					 3. <em>The educational game will mainly provide the educational requirement we identified.</em><br /><p></p>

					 <summary><strong>PROTOTYPE</strong></summary>
					 In the end, we decided to combine all three solutions to create the final design:<br /><br />
					<strong> A simulation that allows the user to choose different stakeholders and allow them to communicate with other stakeholders in the game about the 
					 pros and cons of each perspective.</strong><br /><br />
					 The goal is to try and come up with the best solution to deal with the sea.<br />
					 Afterward, the players will move forward with the most popular plan, and they will get to enforce that plan within a simulated Salton Sea.<br />
					 With the simulation, they will get to watch their plans unfolds on the sea -- for the better or worse.<br />
					 Different stakeholder groups will be able to talk to each other about their plans.<br />
					 To get the stakeholders to come up with a unified plan, the game will only move forward with the most popular plan.<br /><p></p>
					 First, the most logical step was to begin a paper prototype for what we wanted to see in the game.<br /><p></p>
					 <img src="img\projects\saltonsea\paperprototype.png" alt="Prototype #1" class ="imgsize"><br />
					 <img src="img\projects\saltonsea\paperprototype2.jpg" alt="Prototype #2" class ="imgsize"><br />
					 <p></p>
					 Afterward, Axure was used to create a slightly interactive prototype.<br />
					 <em>The link to the prototype and the password to access it is above.</em><br />
					 I will showcase a few prototypes here.<br /><p></p>

					 <p></p>
					<details>
                     <summary><strong>EVALUATIONS</strong></summary>
					 Lastly, a heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, and two think-alouds were performed. <br /><p></p>
					1. The heuristic evaluation showed the problems that fit into each heuristic.<br />
					 There was a minor usability problem about the user being unable to obtain contextual help.<br />
					2. The cognitive walkthrough showed how the user performs each action within the game.<br />
					 The game was simple enough to locate each command and interpret it.<br />
					3. The think aloud evaluations were generally well-received.<br />
					 The only problem was about the direction that the player would like to have.<br />
					 <p></p>
					 If I had more time to work on it, I could:<br />
					 <div id="fragment-5">
					<li><span class ="spanpadding"><em>Provide better information and direction within the game.</em></span></li>
					<li><span class ="spanpadding"><em>Make the voting process clearer and simpler to understand.</em></span></li>
					<li><span class ="spanpadding"><em>Turn the prototype into an actual game.</em></span></li>
					<li><span class ="spanpadding"><em>Find a way to advertise the game to a larger audience.</em></span></li>
