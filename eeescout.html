					<h1>EEE SCOUT</h1>
					<span class ="spanstyle"><strong>April 6, 2016 - June 10, 2016</strong></span><br />
					<em>EEE Scout is an elicitation/specification project of HCI requirements in INF 132: Project in Human Computer Interaction by a group of 6 students.</em><br /><p></p>
					<details open>
                     <summary><strong>THE PROBLEMS</strong></summary>
					 <em>EEE Scout is a web app for building forms and accepting submissions of completed forms.<br />
					 The goal of this project was to evaluate the usability and usefulness of EEE Scout.<br />
					 It was designed specifically for the use of the UCI community.<br /></em>
					 <p></p>In the customer's view, their problems were: <br />
					 1. The site is used mostly for scholarship forms.<br />
					 2. They would like tips on improving the site to increase usability.<br />
					 3. They would like comprehensive tests to be conducted on creating forms and reviewing submission results.<br />
					 4. They would like shorter tests on the completion of Scout forms.<br />
					 <p></p>
					 Upon initial review, we were unable to find a lot wrong with the site, so we started user testing right away.<br />
					 We observed 18 undergrads with varying levels of technical abilities and received 14 completed surveys.<br /><p></p>
					 For the most part, they all had the same problems/suggestions:<br />
					 1. Icons: The hamburger icon was confusing. It was used as a way to grab and move a question.<br />
					 2. Short Answer vs. Essay: There was no character count limit for text responses, so users didn't know when to use each option.<br />
					 3. Multiple Choice vs. Multiple Select: The wording was confusing. Multiple Choice = One Answer Select, Multiple Select = Multiple Answers Allowed.<br />
					 4. Container Truncates Text: It was found that the lowercase letters were being truncated.<br />
					 5. Text Override: Typing in the header won't override the new sample application.<br />
					 6. Done Button at Top: Some users found this button as counter-intuitive.<br />
					 7. Link Opens New Tab: Users had issues navigating back to the page they wanted.<br />
					 <p></p>
					 Users also requested certain features within the application:<br />
					 1. Include Likert Scale Questions (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree)<br />
					 2. Option of some questions being required: All questions are optional and users could submit forms without answering anything.<br />
					 3. Customization: Users are accustomed to high levels of customization in other forms, so they wanted the same features.<br />
					 </details>

					 <summary><strong>METHODS</strong></summary>
					1. <strong>Primary Method</strong>: Interviews with the users who initially interacted with the site and other UCI students with opinions on Scout.<br />
						2. <strong>Secondary Method</strong>: Mix of User Testing and Questionnaires to understand their interactions with the product and their feelings/thoughts.
						<p></p>
						The user types were:<br />
						1. <strong>Entire UCI population</strong>: The entirety of UCI would use this product, and there would be a mix of users that vary from UCI Students to Professors.<br />
						2. <strong>Other Students</strong>: Porting Scout to other universities is a future possibility, so other students outside of UCI should be able to use the product as well.<br />
						<p></p>The two main subgroups were:<br />
						1. Those who have used EEE Scout<br />
						2. Those who have not used EEE Scout<br />
						<p></p>
						The task for the users:<br />
						Step 1: Have the user interact with the site and familiarize themselves.<br />
						Step 2: Have the users create their own forms given a certain scenario.<br />
						Step 3: Have the users fill out a feedback form on their experience.<br />
						It would ask who they were, the purpose of the form they created, if they've used other form systems, issues they ran into, and if they would use the site again.<br />

					<summary><strong>USER TESTING/EVALUATIONS</strong></summary>
					Overall, there were 6 participants available for in-person user testing.<br />
					They were simultaneously given the task to go onto EEE Scout and make a form.<br />
					They were encouraged to ask questions throughout the process and speak their mind.<br /><p></p>
					A few statements were: <br />
					<em>"It would be helpful if there was an undo button."<br />
					"Is there a way to limit word count?"<br />
					"There should be a help video that explains everything."<br />
					"I like the dragging and dropping."<br /></em><p></p>
					Next, 3 out of 6 of the participants were available for an interview about the process afterward. <br />
					They were asked what purpose they create forms for, their general thoughts on the site, any problems, and any features they would like to see. <br />
					Generally, the participants used form builders for different things (if they were president of a club or for a class). <br />
					Google Forms was mainly used, and they found that using Google Forms was simple.<br />
					With their newfound opinion on EEE Scout, they found Scout was basic but a little confusing.<br />
					Regardless, they still thought it was pretty solid the way it was.<br />
					
					<p></p>
					<img src="img\projects\eeescout\heuristic.png" alt="Form" class ="imgsize"><br />	
					<p></p>
					Next, I created 8 heuristic evaluations using Jakob Neilson's Famous Heuristics List.<br />
					For the most part, there wasn't a lot of high priority heuristics besides the hamburger menu.<br />
					An example of a heuristic that scored a severity of 1 was <em>error prevention</em>:<br />
					<strong>The website does not return an error message if the user does not answer a question within the form.</strong><br />
					It was ranked as low priority because EEE Scout wanted the ability of all questions being optional.<br />
					</details>
					<p></p>
					<details>
					<summary><strong>FEEDBACK/THE END</strong></summary>
					After all of that, we sent out a feedback survey to some previous EEE Scout users. <br />
					Over 20 invitations for the survey were sent out; however, only 10 replied: <br />
					<strong>2 faculty, 4 staff, 1 administrative employee, 1 4th year student, 1 PhD candidate, and 1 graduate student.</strong><br />
					<p></p>
					When asked if they liked EEE Scout, 9 said "yes" while only 1 said "no".<br />
					The "no" was because the user believed it could be used for multiple raters to submit blind scores.<br />
					When asked about their overall experience, 9 said "it was good" while one said "it created more work" for them. <br />
					When asked what they wished EEE Scout had, they all stated different general features mentioned already.<br />
					One interesting finding, however, was one person wanting EEE Scout and DUE information systems integrated together.<br />
					<p></p>
					In the end, we recommended that EEE Scout adopt more features from Google Forms for ease of use.<br />
					1. <strong>Allowing some customization is an attractive element.</strong><br />
					2. <strong>Introducing question logic will allow flexibility in creating forms.</strong><br />
					3. <strong>Providing the option for anonymous submissions could entice more users.</strong><br />
					Besides the minor details mentioned earlier, the site is great and useful for the purpose it was built.<br />
					The site is intuitive and delivered positive feedback. <br />
					The only issues found were minor ones, and the major problems could easily be fixed.<br />
					At the end of the day, the client was generous in sharing their vision for EEE Scout with the team throughout this study.<br />
