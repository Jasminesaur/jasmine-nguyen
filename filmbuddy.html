                        <summary><strong>STARTING OUT</strong></summary>
                        The beginning of the project was rather simple. Before being set into teams, we were told to choose an area and observe it.<br />
						Without being told to observe anything specific, I began by observing the movie theater. <br />
						<p></p><strong>PROBLEM AREA: I decided on the movie theater because I was curious about the people attending.<br />
						How can a college student afford the cost of watching a movie weekly? <br />
						Is the movie theater accessible enough for everyone? <br />
						Do people know what movie theaters are in their area? <br />
						Do they know of the deals going on each day?<br />
						</strong>
						<p></p>
						Overall, I had about 4 pages of observations throughout a span of 4 days with 10 minutes each day. <br />
						I noted the date and time of each observation along with some sketching.<br />
						I wrote down everything I saw that ranged from what customers would do to the cleanliness of the theater itself.<br />
						<p></p>
						After the observations, I completed two interviews according to my problem area regarding the movie theater.<br />
						Once the interviews were over, I completed my transcriptions and created a cultural probe.<br />
						The cultural probe consisted of a journal, a disposable camera, map, stickers, and pencils.<br />
						The results I got from the cultural probe were interesting to say the least.<br />
						I gathered the data about the person's lives, thoughts, and values, and kept those in the back of my mind.<br />

                        <summary><strong>INTO TEAMS</strong></summary>
                        Based on my observations, findings from the interviews, and cultural probe, I was then paired up with 5 other people.<br /><br />
						<strong>My Role</strong>: Interviews, Storyboards, Personas, and collaborate on Affinity Diagram, Empathy Diagram, Requirements, Mockups, and Evaluations.<p></p>
						We decided to create a movie theater application; however, we mainly focused on the accessibility aspect.<br />
						We then worked together to create an affinity diagram.<br />
						It was grouped into several categories: Theater Experience, Handicap Accessibility, Home Theater Experience, and Watching Movies Online.<br />
						The conclusion was that people wish their theater-going experience could be better.<br />
						Whether it's ordering concessions or making movie-going more interactive, it could be improved.<br />
						For handicap accessibility, there could be an improved assisted listening system.<br />
						The system could also be more handicap-friendly because, sometimes, using it is difficult.<br />
						For home theater experience, it was found that too many people watch movies at home.<br />
						Sometimes it can be hard to watch a movie if it's on a smaller screen.<br />
						For watching movies online, improving access to movie information was the only complaint.<br />
						It was preferred to watch a movie online.<br />
						<p></p>
						An empathy diagram was created afterward, and it was to determine why people have mixed feelings toward accessibility in theaters.<br />
						There was a general consensus that a lot of people feel sad or angry about accessibility and the rest tend to not say or do much.<br />
						From that information, the new question was: <strong>why would people decide to stay at home instead of watching physical movies in the theater?</strong><br />
						Price and comfort is a huge factor, but the theater really should be more accessible to everyone.<br />
						Two personas were then created:<br />
						<p></p>
						1. <strong> Jane Doe</strong>: A college student that attends the movie theater on a biweekly basis.<br />
						However, she hates enduring the wait times for the box office and concessions. <br />
						With that said, she would rather stay at home instead of driving to the theater.<br />
						However, she prefers to watch movies at the theater because of the big screen and surround system.<br />
						As a college student, she finds that the prices of the tickets and concessions are too much for her.<br />
						<p></p>
						2. <strong> John Doe</strong>: A college student unable to go to the theater often due to his lack of free time.<br />
						If he didn't have to search different websites for information, he would be more interested in going out.<br />
						His goal is to maximize his own time and retrieve good results.<br />
						He enjoys watching Netflix and Amazon; however, since the movies are older, he is conflicted.<br />

                        <summary><strong>USER REQUIREMENTS</strong></summary>
						Afterward, we performed a brainstorming session for the user requirements.<br />
						The goal was to understand what the application should be before creating paper prototypes.<br />
						There were three brainstorming session in total, and the solution ideas ranged from useful to wacky.<br />
						Some of the ideas were: complimentary blankets and glasses to see subtitles.<br />
						It was best to get all of our ideas on paper before beginning the mockups.<br />
						<p></p>
						After creating the user requirements, it was decided that the 4 user needs are:<br />
						1. <strong>Usability</strong>: The application should be easy and familiar to the users.<br />
						2. <strong>Cross Platform</strong>: It should be usable on a computer, tablet, or phone.<br />
						3. <strong>Affordability</strong>: There will be no charge for the app, so it must be affordable to the developers.<br />
						4. <strong>Scalability</strong>: It should be easy to make changes and improvements.<br />
						<p></p>

                        <summary><strong>DESIGN ALTERNATIVES</strong></summary>
						1. <strong>App that sorts the theater by price near your current location</strong><br />
						This design was geared toward college students on a budget.<br />
						The top of the screen would show the date and movie.<br />
						After the location services are turned on, the app will determine which theaters are closest to them based on price.<br />
						It would then show the top three results, but the user can view more results if they desire.<br />
						<p></p>
						2. <strong>App that provides movie information and recommendations from friends based on your movie interests.</strong><br />
						This design was geared toward students who really care about recommendations before watching movies.<br />
						The top of the screen would be the user's profile, and the user would have to include what types of movies they like.<br />
						Their friends would then recommend them movies.<br />
						If the user clicks on their recommendation, it would take them to another screen about the movie's information.<br />
						<p></p>
						3. <strong>App that allows users to see the seating options in the theater.</strong><br />
						This would allow users to see which seats are open before navigating in the dark.<br />
						The top of the screen would show the movie theater, movie, time, and location of the movie they are watching.<br />
						When the app determines where they are, it will outline the theater's seating options.<br />
						Since safety is an issue, a ticket number would be required to use this application.<br />
						<p></p>
						In the end, it was decided to put all three alternatives into one final application.<br />
						Our users should be presented with the cheapest options,
						be recommended movies from their friends, and have a pleasant seat-finding experience.<br />
						<p></p>

                        <summary><strong>STORYBOARDS</strong></summary>
						The next logical step was to create a couple storyboards to show how the application would be used on a day-to-day basis.<br />
						<p></p>
						1. <strong>The first storyboard uses the persona, John Doe, to depict a scenario.</strong><br />
						Since he prefers to stay at home, he uses the app to show him the cheapest and closest theater in his area.<br />
						That way, he won't have to waste extra time and can get back to his college work without having to drive far. <br />
						<p></p>
						2. <strong>The second storyboard uses the persona, Jane Doe, to depict a scenario.</strong><br />
						Since she is a college student on a budget, she uses the app to show her the prices of the movies.<br />
						She determines if the theater is on its discount day.<br />
						If it is, she goes to the movies and saves a couple extra dollars.<br />

                        <summary><strong>SUMMARY</strong></summary>
						After converting the prototype from paper onto Photoshop, we performed a cognitive walkthrough of the design.<br />
						Based on those walkthroughs, it was discovered that there was crucial functionality missing from the design.<br />
						Users were unable to complete the task: registration and searching.<br />
						Users were unable to log in if they didn't already have an account, and they could not search for theaters in another city.<br />
						<p></p>
						A think aloud evaluation was performed next.<br />
						We determined the pros and cons of the prototype by asking users for their suggestions on improvements.<br />
						Users believed that the overall design was implemented well, but the main problem was searching.<br />
						<p></p>
						Lastly, a heuristic evaluation was performed.<br />
						It helped us analyze the different user interface problems that we should resolve.<br />
						<em>The app did not return any error response to the user when they submitted an incorrect username or password.<br />
						The app did not include any documentation on how to use it.<br/ >
						The app also did not provide any system status updates.</em><br />
						<p></p>
						Through the evaluations and the entire process, we understood that key functionality can easily slip past a design.<br />
						The evaluations helped us understand what our users want.<br />
						<p></p>
						If we had more time on the project, we would include:<br />
						<div id="fragment-5">
						<li><span class ="spanpadding"><strong> Search Function</strong>: For users to search up movies/theaters by name.</span></li>
						<li><span class ="spanpadding"><strong> Registration</strong>: For new users to sign up.</span></li>
						<li><span class ="spanpadding"><strong> Offline Use</strong>: For users that don't have access to the internet.</span></li>
